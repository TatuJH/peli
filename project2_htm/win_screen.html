        You arrive at the Ancient Chamber well in time.
        It's finally time to complete the ritual. You reach for your backpack and pull out the artefacts you have collected.
        Beside each candle in the circle, there is a small slot. You place the artefacts in the slots, one by one, and feel everything start to gradually shake.
        The chamber fills with fog, and you see something blurry in front of you. Or rather, someone.
        A figure steps through the fog, the chamber echoing with his footsteps. Your god stands before you, fully materialized.
        "Congratulations", the voice says, "you have done me proud." The divine being touches you, and you ascend to a higher state of being.
