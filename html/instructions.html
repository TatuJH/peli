    <p class="instructions_text">You belong in a cult dead-set on waking up an ancient god.
                   After centuries of hard work, the moment is finally at hand.
                   You arrive in an ancient chamber located in Antarctica. The chamber smells of sulfur and debris on the ground seems to move on its own.
                   In the middle of the chamber lies a circle made of lit candles. You step in, and start performing a ritual.
                   You feel the air rising as a fading projection of your god appears in front of you. You hear a deep voice.
                   The voice commands you to bring him six artefacts - one from each of the other continents - to finish the ritual.
                   After you have found and collected an artefact from every other continent, you shall return to Antarctica.
                   You are given limited time to complete your quest - otherwise the ritual fails.
                   In addition, to ensure your obedience, a spirit is sent after you. You feel as if you don't want to make contact with it.
                   You leave the chamber as a waning voice behind you asks you to hurry.</p>

    <p class="instructions_text">Important things to note:<br>
                   - You only have a limited number of actions on each airport, and if you don't depart as your last action, the spirit will catch you.<br>
                   - Working gives you money, but costs you time.<br>
                   - Exploring consists of randomized events, which can both cost and reward money, time or artefacts.<br>
                   - Converting heretics is a fighting minigame. Winning nets you money. The actions are as follows:<br>
                     * STRIKE (#) decreases the selected enemy's stamina, but has a chance to miss.<br>
                     * HEAL (#) heals you based on your current stamina, and has limited uses.<br>
                     * GUARD decreases the amount of stamina you lose from enemy attacks.<br>
                   - In the auction house you can either buy or sell artefacts.<br>
                   - Each action consumes days in addition to other costs.<br>
                   - Traveling to another continent costs more.<br>
                   - Airport size determines the cost of travel and affects some rewards.</p>
